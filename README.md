# koa-rest
The code is structured in a way that let you build huge and extendable REST services based on generators. To let you see it in action I

This code boilerplate was developed to build RESTful micro-services for
online educational project [univeroom.com](http://univeroom.com)

To run in development:gulp dev
test
